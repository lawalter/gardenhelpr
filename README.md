- Generate planting recommendations based on phytosociology (i.e. what vegatables should/should not be planted together)
- Calculate the average ideal soil pH 
- Calculate average watering needs
- Calculate average sunlight requirements
- Report pH, water, and sunlight outliers so they can be planted separately
